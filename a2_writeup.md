# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I think that the most difficult task while completing the match functions was getting used to all the new functions like .join and things like result.append(" ".join(source[slocation:sind])) because it's hard to have memorized the order and understand exactly what each thing does. I think this is just something that over time the more often I see it the better I'll be able to grasp it's concept and be comfortable using it.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I can use the match function for extracting information from a movie database to give the user a more acurate and better response that will match what they are asking for better than if we didn't. It would also help a lot because it would be faster to give results and it's beneficial to be able to have something like that than having to do a lot more work without it.
